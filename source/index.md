## Experience


#### **Research Engineer, Reservoir Labs | June 2017 - Present
* Working on advanced research and development projects, involving the development of algorithms
  for machine learning and network engineering. Published two first-author papers and presented at
  academic conferences. Submitted two Provisional Patent Applications (PPAs).
* Used C, C++, Python, Apache Spark, Scala


#### **Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Cofounder, Knowsun Consulting | May 2016 - Present
* Developed and implemented machine learning algorithms to meet business needs. Regularly
communicated with clients to understand business and technology needs and developed algorithms
that produced an effective and desired solution. Collaborated with a team of PhD's as well as frontend software engineers 
* Used Python and C

#### **Research Assistant, Yale University School of Public Health | May 2015 - Present
* Statistically analyzed genome data involving gene expression patterns during embryogenesis of
fungi to determine whether certain evolutionary markers are still functionally extant. Published a
paper as a result of this work.
* Used R, C, and Python

#### **Research Assistant, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies | November 2014 - September 2015
* Performed data analysis and machine learning to model structure-activity relationships of different
compounds to predict cytotoxicity. Published two papers as a result of this work. 
* Used C
